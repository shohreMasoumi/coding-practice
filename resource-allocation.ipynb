    "Combinatorial optimization within constraints is a popular computer science challenge. It is a practical example of the knapsack problem, manifesting itself in scenarios such as budget allocation or inventory management within supply chains in real-world applications. \n",

    "To tackle these kinds of problems, we often use methods like Greedy Algorithms and Dynamic Programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will begin with simpler formulations and gradually work our way up to harder variations."
