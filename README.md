# Coding Practice
Here are some coding projects and exercises to keep mine and yours programming skills sharp!

## Resource Allocation
Combinatorial optimization within constraints is a popular computer science challenge. It is a practical example of the knapsack problem, manifesting itself in scenarios such as budget allocation or inventory management within supply chains in real-world applications. 

To tackle these kinds of problems, we often use methods like Greedy Algorithms and Dynamic Programming.

We will begin with simpler formulations and gradually work our way up to harder variations.

## Calculator
I begin by creating a basic Calculator class featuring just two methods, gradually progressing towards a more intricate version that handles parentheses and more complex operations.
