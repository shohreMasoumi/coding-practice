## Data Structures and Algorithms

### Largest Elements

TBD

### Resource Allocation

Combinatorial optimization within constraints is a popular computer science challenge. It is a practical example of the knapsack problem, manifesting itself in scenarios such as budget allocation or inventory management within supply chains in real-world applications. 

To tackle these kinds of problems, we often use methods like Greedy Algorithms and Dynamic Programming.

We will begin with simpler formulations and gradually work our way up to harder variations.

### Shuffling

Exploring shuffling algorithms: conventional, in-place, and finally Fisher-Yates for unbiased and efficient randomization.

### Longest Consecutive Subsequence
This problem involves finding the length of the longest sequence of consecutive integers present in an unsorted list. The sequence must be formed using the elements of the list with or without rearranging them.

## Machine Learning

### Kaggle Titanic Competition

[Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic)

Kaggle competitions provide ideal environments for refining data science and machine learning abilities while exploring diverse methodologies. This is my first machine learning project since graduating three years ago. 

I start with exploratory data analysis, followed by processing data, and feature engineering. While I do not implement the models, I discuss four of the most popular ML models for binary classification and compare their evaluations.

## Distributed Systems

### Unique Id Generator

This problem involves designing a system that produces unique identifiers across multiple machines or instances. <br>
We study different aspects of distributed systems design and explore Python threading techniques.
